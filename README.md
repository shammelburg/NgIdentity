####An application using AngularJS with TypeScript &amp; ASP.NET Identity


The main focus of this application is to get the fundamental functionality for ASP.NET Identity to work with Angular JS and TypeScript. 
ASP.nET Identity has many great features out of the box and I want to include them in this project.

So far,
User features,
* Registering
* Logging in
* Sending Confirmation Email
* Sending Forgot Password Email
* Resetting Password from Email Link
* Changing your Password (When logged in)
* Amending UserName/Email (When logged in)

Admin features,
* List of registered users
* Editing user details
* List of roles
* Adding roles
* Removing roles

More to be added soon, hopefully
